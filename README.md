## What's the problem?

Have you ever been to a local shop, bought something, and heard the customers say, "Bhaiya, note kar lo, baad mein de dunga"? Then he pulls out that same old torn diary, scribbles down your items one by one, and adds it to a long list of pending payments.

It’s a system that hasn’t changed in decades. And almost every small business owner struggles with the same things:

- How much am I earning?
- What payments are still pending?
- What’s been paid and how?
- What’s selling well?
- Who are my repeat customers?

But the problem is—setting up complex POS systems, buying expensive computers, using barcode scanners, or juggling between complicated apps and Excel sheets just isn’t realistic for them. These business owners don’t need fancy dashboards filled with complex charts. They need simplicity.


That’s where we come in. We’re building a simple, lightweight web app that works right out of the box. No setup headaches. No tech jargon. Just open it up and:

- Add your menu/items
- Add customers
- Generate bills
- Track payments

Get insights — all in one place, on your fingertips

And to be clear — we’re not just another app for cash flow tracking or stock management. We're reimagining POS for small businesses, from billing to customer management to analytics — all made effortless, intuitive, and accessible.
