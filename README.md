## ü§î What's the problem?

Have you ever been to a local shop, bought something, and heard the customers say, "Bhaiya, note kar lo, baad mein de dunga"? Then he pulls out that same old torn diary, scribbles down your items one by one, and adds it to a long list of pending payments.

It‚Äôs a system that hasn‚Äôt changed in decades. And almost every small business owner struggles with the same things:

- How much am I earning?
- What payments are still pending?
- What‚Äôs been paid and how?
- What‚Äôs selling well?
- Who are my repeat customers?

But the problem is‚Äîsetting up complex POS systems, buying expensive computers, using barcode scanners, or juggling between complicated apps and Excel sheets just isn‚Äôt realistic for them. Their earning is low and schedule is busy but their business is important to same level. These business owners don‚Äôt need fancy dashboards filled with complex charts. They need simplicity.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we are solving that?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Engineered by: Team ByteMates

**Team ByteMates** developed this project during **HackByte 3.0** ‚Äî a 36-hour hackathon held from **4th to 6th April 2025** at **IIITDM Jabalpur, MP**.

The inspiration for our idea came from a conversation with a small businessman who runs a mess meal delivery service. He once shared a challenge he was facing, and that stuck with us. We took it as a personal mission to solve that problem ‚Äî and that's how **Shopeaze** was born.

This project is still a work in progress, and we're continuing to build on it even after the hackathon. The **dev mode is still on**, and we're excited to make it even better in the coming weeks.

Let us introduce you to the team behind **Shopeaze** and the roles each of us played in bringing this idea to life.
